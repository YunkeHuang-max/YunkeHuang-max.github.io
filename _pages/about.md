Dr. Yunke Huang received the Ph.D. degree in 2021 from Northwestern Polytechnical
University. She was a Joint Ph.D. student at the Intelligent Computational Engineering Laboratory [ICE LAB](https://icelab.uk), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, the University of Strathclyde, UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Edmondo Minisci](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/minisciedmondodr/#contact). 
 She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Komura, Taku](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku). Before joined the University of Hong Kong, she was a
Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [Fan Shi](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/fan-shi).

Dr. Yunke Huangâ€™s main research interest is computational mechanics,
acoustics/ultrasonics, and multi-robot systems. She has published more than 10 peer
reviewed journal/conference papers, including the top specialized journal (e.g., Continuum
Mechanics and Thermodynamics (CMT), The Journal of the Acoustical Society of
America (JASA) and IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).
